# Shopping List

## About

ShoppingList is a console application, developed with C# and .NET 7, that allows you to browse a grocery stores products and make a grocery list. It uses a database of grocery store products implemented with Entity Framework Core and SQLite. You can view, add, update, and remove items from the product database. It also allows you to create a shopping list from the database. You can view your shopping list and total price, add items to your list (that are inserted in order by the items location in the store), and remove items from your list. The total price is updated as you add or remove items. There is an option to email the list to an email address, but the sending of the email is not functional.
